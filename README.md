# contact-angularjs

A little moment with my first angularjs app. Nothing special, just tried it for the first time to get an impression.

## What is the project?
I'm sorry, this is not a project. I just built a contact-listing app with angular.js because I want to get an impression
on the niceness of AngularJS.
This is more of a study for me to learn AngularJS for now.

### What I would do, though:

* Update this repo when the workflow is improved.
* I will try to tag often whenever I learn something new from AngularJS and it is implemented.
  * If not in the master: At least I will have it available in a separate branch.

# Functionality

* Adding a new contact
* Editing contact ( via "contenteditable" attribute )
* Done.

# TODO

## App
* Workflow: Now a contact is editable by default. Enforce ng-dbclick to make it editable.
* Workflow: Add a tooltip when hovering on an editable part.

This is my attempt to add couchDB support. I do hope that I update the package.json properly.
There was much angularjs coding here, more like messing around with couchDB + Cradle. Like couchDB so far..

ciao, baby!
